# Imager
> Brute force image optimization; optimizes the compression using ML based metrics in a trial ’n error sorta manner.

## About

This is a tool that can competitively optimize (e.g.) extremely noisy, high resolution images; at the expense of increased encoding time and CPU overhead. This is a tradeoff that should be suitable for over 90% of online content, where site performance matters.


## [Benchmarks](https://github.com/colbyn/imager-bench-2019-11-2)

## Status - Fundamental

### Supported **Input** Image Formats

| Format | Decoding |
| ------ | -------- |
| PNG    | All supported color types |
| JPEG   | Baseline and progressive |
| GIF    | Yes |
| BMP    | Yes |
| ICO    | Yes |
| TIFF   | Baseline(no fax support) + LZW + PackBits |
| WebP   | Lossy(Luma channel only) |
| PNM    | PBM, PGM, PPM, standard PAM |

Essentially supports any image decodable by [image-rs](https://github.com/image-rs/image.git).

### Supported **Output** Image Formats

> These are your optimization targets (for lack of a better name). It’s a bit higher level, since e.g. rate control is automatically handled.

| Format | Encoding |
| ------ | -------- |
| JPEG   | progressive |

For now, support will pretty much just correspond to whats popularly available in browsers. I’m considering `WebP` for the next supported codec.

## Objective
Nothing short of becoming *the industry standard* for image optimization! :)

More concretely. Expose a uniform interface for image transcoding and optimization of popular codecs. Based on off-the-shelf encoders, akin to FFmpeg. With support predominately concerned with lossy codecs.

## More to come
Stay tuned for future updates. Currently in the works is an http server, and support for other image formats.

## Feedback & Feature Requests
Just use the GitHub issue tracker for this project.

## Bugs, Confusion, Performance Issues
Just use the GitHub issue form.

Regarding performance, Imager may be ‘slower’ but it shouldn’t be ‘too slow’, kindly open a new issue if such is the case for you.
